- 🌐 Personal website under construction ~~(noted with the train of thought~)
### Notes while learning
- <a href="https://nocounter87.github.io/nocounter87/Dense.html">全连接层Dense()的一维性特性</a>
- [模型架构]->[Dense全连接层]->[Flatten是做什么的？]->[Dense为什么是一维的？]->[局部特征缺失]->[Dense的局限性]-->[CNN]
  
- [Model Architecture] → [Fully-connected Dense Layer] → [Why Flatten?] → [Why Dense is inherently 1D?] → [Loss of local spatial features] → [Limitations of Dense] → [Transition to CNN

- <a href="https://nocounter87.github.io/nocounter87/pixel.html">像素游戏与计算机视觉</a>
-[CNNs]->[池化与抽象]->[图像可视化；像素的抽象]->[像素艺术]->[像素级别的图像识别]-->[人与CNN的识别机制比较分析]-->[期待与贝叶斯先验]

-→ [CNNs] → [Pooling & abstraction] → [Image visualization: What is a pixel?] → [Pixel Art vs. Perception]  
→ [How humans and CNNs recognize structure differently]  
→ [Bayesian priors, expectations & perception — a future curiosity]
